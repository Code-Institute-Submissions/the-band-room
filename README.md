# Owner Goals

#### For the owner the initial goals are:

* To quickly deliver to the user the basics of what the site has to offer

#### Long-term goals for the owner are:

* To offer a full serviced one-stop solution

# User Goals

#### For the user the goals are:

* To be able to quickly access and make use of the sites main services
* 


# User Stories

1. "As a **band leader** I'm looking for a complete solution to scheduling and organizing my band activities."


# My Strategy

* My goal was to ensure the information was easy to access while striving for a responsive, simple and colorful design.

# Structure

* I wanted the landing page to be simple and make it easy for the user to quickly get straight to the main purpose and service of the site.

# User Interface
* 

* Fonts I chose are:
  * <a href="" target="_blank"></a> 
  * <a href="" target="_blank"></a> 
  * <a href="" target="_blank"></a> 

# Features

* 

# Features still to implement

*

# Scope

* The current scope of the project is limited, most of the intended features have yet to be implemented. The main reason for this is the limited time frame in which the project must be completed.
* Other reasons for the limited scope was because I wanted to take the time to focus on and implement the CRUD features of the site.

# To preview in your browser

If you are using gitpod as your IDE:
The project runs only from the Master branch the main directory of which is:  /workspace/the-band-room
When in the main directory enter the following into the command prompt
1. python3 app.py
2. This will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8080.
3. If you are working in Gitpod this will give you an option to 'open browser' which will open the default route '/the_band_room'
4. If you want to stop the local server from running, in the command prompt simply press crtl + C
